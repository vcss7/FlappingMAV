# FlappingMAV Optimizing the lift-to-drag ratio of flapping micro-air vehicles.

This repository aims to provide a guide to running an Unsteady Vortex Lattice
Method Simulation on the kinematics of flapping wings on a micro-air vehicle
The goal is to optimize the flapping motion to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio
by using the VTDIRECT95 optimization algorithm.

We will attempt to replicate the results found in the study conducted by Mehdi
Ghommem, Muhammad R. Hajj, Layne T. Watson, Dean T. Mook, Richard D. Snyder and
Philip S. Beran titled Deterministic Global Optimization of Flapping Wing
Motion for Micro Air Vehicles in 2010. DOI:
